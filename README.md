# UU-Tex 
This pack mainly focuses on retexturing GT5U, specifically GTNH's version.

This includes circuits, crafting components (ie motors, pistons, etc,), multiblocks (including GT++, TecTech, Goodgenerator, etc,).

So far most blocks in base GT have been retextured, as well as items, the goal is to completely retexture base GT, then all other GT5U related mods.
